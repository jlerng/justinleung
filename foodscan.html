								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<div class="smaller">
									<p>This project was an assignment from my Information Technology Management class at the University of California, Riverside. The main objective of this project was to design an app prototype that helps solve an everyday problem for college students.</p>

									<p>Currently, most recipe apps only allow users to discover new recipes <b>through different categories</b> such as cuisines, cooking times, or difficulties. However, the <b>vast amount of options</b> offered on these apps can be <b>overwhelming</b> for college students who have just started cooking for themselves.</p>

                                	<p>In the span of a week, I focused on designing an app to help <b>assist college students in finding new recipes based on individual ingredients that they already have on hand.</b> </p>

									</div>
                                    <div class="smaller">
                                        <p>Many busy college students prefer ordering take-out rather than having to plan three meals a day and go grocery shopping. Although going out to eat is typically more expensive and unhealthier compared to home-cooked meals, students prefer quick and convenient access to food. Thus, the main tradeoff of cooking meals at home is that it's time-consuming for students who have to balance their classwork, jobs, and social life.</p>

								<h2>Making Improvements</h2>
								<p class="smaller" style="color:#aeadad">After creating my lo-fi prototype, I asked users to test and evaluate the functionality of an early-stage FoodScan. I then revamped certain parts of the app architecture to be more intuitive and increase overall accessibility for users.</p>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>Resizing &#38; Decluttering Recipe Cards</h4>
								<p class="smaller">Previously, recipe cards within the entire app were <b>small and accompanied by a large description.</b> This was altered because many users expressed that there were too many words in such a small space. As a result, it made the app <b>cluttered and unappealing.</b> To combat this, <b>recipe cards were enlarged and descriptions were changed to only include the name of the recipe and the cooking time.</b> Taking advantage of the excess space, descriptions were then moved to the bottom so that two recipe cards could be aligned next to each other.</p>

								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>Adjusting The Scan Feature</h4>
								<p class="smaller">The scan feature was initially <b>combined with the upload function.</b> However, this <b>confused users</b> because the icon on the bottom bar only specified the function as a scan feature. <b>The functions for uploading a recipe were removed from the scanning screen</b> and a new button for uploading was placed on the homepage. Also, the scan function was no longer a two-step process. First, users had to go into the scanning screen and then press a button to enter an additional screen in order to access the camera and begin scanning. Instead, <b>a camera for scanning was implemented directly into the scanning screen.</b></p>

								</div>
								<br>
								<br>
								<br>
								<h4>Revamping The Recipe Input Process</h4>
								<p class="smaller" style="color:#aeadad">Users expressed that the process of inputting details into a personal recipe was <b>convoluted and non-practical.</b> The previous format was structured based on what a final recipe page would look like. However, that simply made it more difficult for users, especially through a phone screen. All inputs have been <b>switched to text boxes</b> that are centered on the screen. "Adding Ingredients" and "Adding a Step" now have their <b>own individual sections.</b> "Prep Time," "Cook Time," and "Serving Size" have all been added to allow users more customizable options. Finally, the preview of the recipe has been moved to a different screen and can be accessed by the <b>"Finalize" button.</b></p>

								<h2>Reflecting On the Project</h2>
								<h4>Takeaways</h4>
								<p class="smaller">This was my first UI/UX project and I learned a great deal during the entire process. This case study taught me to carefully plan out my decisions before committing to a finalized product. In addition, I also learned more about researching and catering my app’s functions to meet user needs and expectations.</p>
								<br>
								<h4>Challenges</h4>
								<p class="smaller">The most challenging part of this project was learning basic UI/UX skills from scratch and utilizing them in tandem to create something meaningful for users. As much as I would have wanted to perfect everything in my project, I also had a due date and time constraints. Not having prior knowledge about UI/UX slowed me down quite a bit and forced me to make decisions between speed and accuracy.</p>
								<p class="smaller">It was also very difficult to design a recipe app that could solve many people’s problems all at once because everyone is connected to food differently. Creating a recipe app with very strong contenders in the market was also a major problem. I struggled with figuring out how my app would stand out in the current market while being new and innovative for users.</p>
								<br>
								<h4>Next Steps</h4>
								<p class="smaller">By no means is FoodScan a completed app and I really wanted to make many major adjustments after submitting my project. First, I feel that there is a clear lack of connectivity between components within my app. If I had additional time, I would want to establish clear cards for major components, rather than relying on a simple image. I also want to re-explore the homepage and create something more eye-catching for users. Right now, I feel that there is something lacking that could push the homepage to the next level.</p>
								<p class="smaller">Exploring further ideas, I want to create a catalog within the app that would help users with tracking which ingredients they had on hand. This feature would function cohesively with bookmarks and checklists so that certain ingredients would already be checked off if the items were in your catalog. Ultimately, the goal would be to help users manage their groceries and save them time when making grocery trips.</p>
